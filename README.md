Part 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
We have analyzed the login times by seasonl, weekdays, and hours. We found that the logins most occur in Saturday and Sunday.

By investigating into hours, logins most occur at late night and (21 ~ 2). The logins start to increase from 21, peak at 22, decrease after 1. During the lunch time (11 ~ 12), logins increase for a while.

Combining weekdays and hours, we can see that most users log in most of the late nights and dawns on Sundays and Saturdays.
